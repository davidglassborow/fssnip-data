F# Snippets - Data dump
=======================

The repository contains the dump of snippets from [fssnip.net](http://fssnip.net). You'll need this
if you want to play with F# snippets locally. See the README in the [main repository](https://github.com/fssnippets/fssnip-website)
for more information.

 * `index.json` is index with metadata about snippets (with all passwords omitted)
 * `source` contains raw text entered for each snippet (with sub-directory containing one or more versions)
 * `formatted` contains the formatted HTML (produced by a script in the [tools repository](https://github.com/fssnippets/fssnip-tools))
